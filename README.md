# X'plor

X'plor is a trip planning web application designed to allow users to plan/save their vacation details for their next big trip... As a user, you can search for cities, create trips, save packing lists, flight and hotel information, as well as restaurants and attractions from our Yelp Fusion API search. Our app solves the problem of travelers forgetting to visit and experience certain places on their vacation, all their plans are saved in one place, X'Plor!

## Motivation: 
When deciding on an app to create, our group established that we all share similar interests in traveling and exploring new places. This trip planner can be used to plan a trip to any location in the US!

## About The Project:
X'plor was a week long group project in our Genereal Assembly Bootcamp, Trevor Mwangi, Brey Shaw and I collaborated to create a fully functioning application to share with our class! After the cohort ended, I have continued to work on the site to add personal feautures to showcase my vision for the application.

# Planning:

Check out our [trello](https://trello.com/b/uRqxYp1i/xplor)! The trello was used heavily to track workflow. We established a task system so that we could pull up trello at any time, see what everyone is currently working on, and take a look at tasks that still need to be done.
