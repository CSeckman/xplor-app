# X'plor

X'plor is a trip planning web application designed to allow users to establish a destination, search for restaurants and attractions using the Yelp API, and add them to a planned trip.

Visit the site [here](https://xplor-usa.herokuapp.com/).

## Motivation: 
When deciding on an app to create, our group established that we all share similar interests in traveling and exploring new places. This trip planner can be used to plan a trip to any location in the US!

## Site:

Check out our [trello](https://trello.com/b/uRqxYp1i/xplor)! The trello was used heavily to track workflow. We established a task system so that we could pull up trello at any time, see what everyone is currently working on, and take a look at tasks that still need to be done.
